# Gopher Game Server
Gopher Game Server is a full-featured game server written in Go. Also comes with a client API for JavaScript (and eventually Java, C++, and C)

Gopher's aim is to provide all the tools necessary to make any type of online game (or any real-time app/chat) a breeze to develop. Gopher will take care of all server-side synchronizing, so you can recieve client actions, set variables, send messages, and much more without having to worry about it!

-PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT-

## Client APIs

 - JavaScript: [Gopher Client JS](https://github.com/hewiefreeman/GopherClientJS)

The Java, C++, and C (possibly more with some help) client APIs will be made after completing the Go server and JavaScript client API.
